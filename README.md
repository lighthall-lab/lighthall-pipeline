# lighthall-pipeline
A working pipeline for parallel processing of neuroimaging data on SLURM-based compute cluster, for https://github.com/lighthall-lab/.
Cloned from https://github.com/lucychenrobotics/Nipype-Pipeline-AD-D after her work on the pre-processing steps.

Removed a mess of old crash files in the latest branch, but we still have some cleanup work to do in sorting out which pre-processing steps belong in the current workflow.
